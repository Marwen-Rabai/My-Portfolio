# Email Setup Guide for Contact Form

## Current Status ‚úÖ
Your contact form is **WORKING** but currently only logs messages to the console. To receive actual emails, you need to set up one of the options below.

## Quick Solution (Recommended) üöÄ

### Option 1: EmailJS (Easiest - 5 minutes)
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a free account
2. Create a new email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create an email template
4. Get your service ID, template ID, and user ID
5. Update the contact form (I'll help you with this)

### Option 2: Simple Mailto Link (Instant)
The contact form already includes a direct mailto link to `marwenrabai@proton.me` - users can click this to open their email client directly.

## What You Need to Do:

**If you want emails sent to your inbox automatically:**
1. Choose one of the options above
2. I'll help you implement it
3. Test the form
